# Project Summary Page Template

## What is this?

This project summary page provides a landing page to showcase your team's work on your final project for employers, or anyone else you want to share your work with.

There is just one page, `index.html`, and it is set up so that you can customize it easily by just changing the content. There is no javascript and no framework -- just plain old markup. It's meant to be published on GitHub pages (more on that below).

[Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is used for styling. The font icons are SVGs from [Octicons](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/). You are welcome to customize the styling, but you don't have to.

## How to work with this

This repo is a template repo, which will allow you to create a copy in your team's GitHub organization. See the [GitHub docs for how to create a new repo from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

After you have made your own repo from the template, one dev on the team should clone the repo from your Github organization and be in charge of making edits. You can have multiple people making edits if you have a good, agreed upon git workflow, but it might be easiest to just have one person working on it.

Open `index.html` in the browser to see it rendered (it is easy to do this with `open index.html` from the command line). Read the content. You'll see what you should change. Make the edits that reflect your team's content.

Save your changes, commit, and push to your fork in your team's organization.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

[Follow the documentation on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) to create a live version of the project page. You will need to share the URL with Momentum staff using [this form](https://forms.gle/4poXjCsZJxjdp8Ce8).
